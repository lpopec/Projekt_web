            The Ford Fiesta has a well-deserved reputation for being the small car that will put the biggest smile on your face when you drive it. 
            But there are plenty more reasons why the Fiesta has been top of the sales charts for more than a decade.
        </p>

            It certainly helps that there's a Ford Fiesta to suit most tastes. You can have a (relatively) cheap one that looks like butter wouldn’t melt, 
            a sportier-looking ST-Line model that mimics the near-200bhp Fiesta ST hot hatch, or opt for a touch of luxury with the chrome-adorned Vignale. 
            Ford has even considered the booming popularity of small SUVs by offering an Active model, complete with tough-looking black wheel arches, 
            jacked-up suspension and roof rails – although if you want a small SUV we reckon you'd be better off looking at the brilliant Ford Puma.
        </p>

            There are lots of engines to choose from, too, including several mild-hybrid petrols that offer punchy acceleration and excellent fuel economy. 
            Indeed, just about the only thing you can't have is a pure electric Fiesta; if it's a Fiesta-sized electric car you're after then we'd point you towards the Peugeot e-208 or Renault Zoe.
