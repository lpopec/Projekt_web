                <h1>New 2022 BMW M2: prices, specs and launch date</h1>
                <h2>The new BMW M2 coupe will feature a detuned version of the M3’s 3.0-litre straight-six, but it’ll still have upwards of 400bhp</h2>
                <p>
                    BMW’s M division is working on a project that’s certain to excite the brand’s traditional fanbase – a replacement for the much-loved M2 coupe. The second-generation model will make its debut later this year, and our exclusive images preview how it could look.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The previous-generation M2 was a key model for BMW’s M division. Back in 2018, the brand labelled the car as its “strongest growth driver”, so the success of this new model is vital, even though the firm’s portfolio has since expanded to include more popular performance vehicles, such as SUVs and even electric cars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BMW’s next M2 will take advantage of the fresh platform found under the new 2 Series coupe, which was derived from that of the 3 Series. However, there’ll be significant changes over the powertrains and chassis in the standard 2 Series.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Power should come from BMW M’s latest turbocharged 3.0-litre straight-six petrol engine, found in the likes of the X3 M and X4 M performance SUVs. Codenamed S58, the unit develops 503bhp in BMW’s flagship Competition trim but, so the M2 doesn’t tread on the toes of its larger (and more expensive) siblings, we expect BMW will limit the coupe’s output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like the rest of BMW’s M line-up, the M2 will be offered with two power outputs – there’ll be a standard variant at the entry-level and a more potent Competition option acting as the flagship. The M2 base model will have at least 400bhp, which will provide enough breathing space between the M2 and the new M240i xDrive, which produces 369bhp.
                </p>
