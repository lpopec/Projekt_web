                <h1>Vauxhall Insignia to be reborn as SUV in 2024</h1>
                <h2>In a bid to boost sales Vauxhall's Insignia will morph into a crossover – and our exclusive images preview how it could look</h2>
                <p>
                    It seems the public has an insatiable need for crossovers – and Vauxhall is more than happy to meet its demands. So much so, that the company’s next-generation Insignia will ditch its low-slung liftback styling in favour of a tall-riding SUV stance, which the company hopes will reignite interest in the model following a slump in sales. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the new design brief, we expect the next Insignia will be based on the same eVMP underpinnings as the Peugeot’s upcoming replacements for the 3008 and 5008 SUVs. That also means the crossover will be available with a choice of electric powertrains, offering between 250 and 400 miles of range, depending on the battery pack and motors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The eVMP architecture is compatible with batteries ranging between 60kWh and 100kWh in capacity – and there’ll likely be a broad range of electric motor configurations, starting with the 134bhp front-wheel drive powertrain from the Corsa-e and topping-out with a 335bhp dual-motor, four-wheel drive system in the flagship. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those unwilling to make the shift to EV power will also be pleased to hear that Stellantis’s eVMP chassis is basically a heavily reworked version of the company’s existing EMP2 platform, meaning Vauxhall will be able to offer plug-in hybrid power on the Insignia, alongside these new electric models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vauxhall (and stablemates Citroen and Peugeot) hasn’t released any details about the PHEV system destined for its next-generation vehicles. Currently, the firm uses a 296bhp 1.6-litre unit with a 13.2kWh battery pack, which offers a maximum range of around 40 miles. However, that could easily be updated for the brand’s next-gen models.
                </p>
