                <h1>New 2022 Range Rover Sport: specifications and UK launch date</h1>
                <h2>The next Range Rover Sport follows its full-sized fifth-gen sibling – and there’s an SVR model on the way which could have more than 600bhp</h2>
                <p>
                    Land Rover has only just pulled the sheets off the fifth-generation Range Rover – but the company already has another new car almost ready to go. The next-generation Range Rover Sport will follow the brand’s flagship off-roader into the showrooms at the end of 2022, featuring the same design language and technology. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it eventually goes on sale, the new Range Rover Sport will rival everything from the BMW X5 to the pure-electric Audi e-tron. Land Rover will achieve this breadth of ability by moving the SUV onto its new Modular Longitudinal Architecture (MLA), which can accomodate 48-volt mild-hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric powertrains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jaguar Land Rover has previously announced it will collaborate with BMW on the electric drive units for its next-generation vehicles. The electric Range Rover will hit UK showrooms in 2024 – and we expect an electric Range Rover Sport will follow closely behind, using the same EV technology as the upcoming BMW i5 and i7 saloons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Buyers will also be offered a performance-oriented, SVR-badged variant, as illustrated by the sporty-looking prototypes in our gallery. Despite the brand’s focus on electrification, we expect this model will take a more old-school approach to performance, featuring the same twin-turbocharged 4.4-litre V8 engine found in the BMW X5 M Competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Land Rover has already confirmed that the same engine will be available in the full-sized Range Rover, albeit only in BMW’s detuned 523bhp guise. However, given the Sport SVR’s racy brief, we anticipate it’ll get the full 616bhp that the engine is capable of producing, putting its performance on par with the fastest version of the X5.
                </p>
